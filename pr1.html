      <center>In Praise of Shadows</center>
    </h1>

       <h2>
        <center>I possess no specialized knowledge of architecture, but I understand that in the Gothic cathedral</center>
         <center>of the West, the roof is thrust up and up so as to place its pinnacle as high in the heavens</center>
         <center>as possible-and that herein is thought to lie its special beauty. In the temples of Japan, on</center>
         <center>the other hand, a roof of heavy tiles is first laid out, and in the deep, spacious shadows created</center>
         <center>by the eaves the rest of the structure is built. Nor is this true only of temples;in the places</center>
         <center>of the nobility and the houses of the common people, what first strikes the eye is the massive</center>
         <center>roof of tile or thatch and the heavy darkness that hangs beneath the eaves. Even at midday cavernous</center>
         <center>darkness spreads over all beneath the roof's edge, making entryway,doors, walls, and pillars all</center>
         <center>but invisible. The grand temples of Kyoto-Chion'in, Honganji-and the farmhouses of the remote</center>
         <center>countryside are alike in this respect: like most buildings of the past their roofs give the impression</center>
         <center>of possessing far greater weight, height, and surface than all that stands beneath the eaves.</center>

      <h2>
        <center>In making for ourselves a place to live, we first spread a parasol to throw a shadow on the earth, and</center>
        <center>in the pale light of the shadow we put together a house. There are of course roofs on Western houses</center>
        <center>too, but they are less to keep off the sun than to keep off the wind and the dew; even from without</center>
        <center>it is apparent that they are built to create as few shadows as possible and to expose the interior </center>
        <center>to as much light as possible. If the roof of a Japanese house is a parasol, the roof of a Western</center>
        <center>house is no more than a cap, with as small a visor as possible so as to allow the sunlight to</center>
        <center>penetrate directly beneath the eaves. There are no doubt all sorts of reasons-climate, building materials-</center>
        <center>for the deep Japanese eaves. The fact that we did not use glass, concrete, and bricks, for instance,</center>
        <center>made a low roof necessary to keep off the driving wind and rain. A light room would no doubt have been</center>
        <center>more convenient for us, too, than a dark room. The quality that we call beauty, however, must always</center>
        <center>grow from the realities of life, and our ancestors, forced to live in dark rooms, presently came to</center>
        <center>discover beauty in shadows, ultimately to guide shadows towards beauty's ends.</center>
