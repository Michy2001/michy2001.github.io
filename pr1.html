        I possess no specialized knowledge of architecture, but I understand that in the Gothic cathedral
          of the West, the roof is thrust up and up so as to place its pinnacle as high in the heavens
          as possible-and that herein is thought to lie its special beauty. In the temples of Japan, on
          the other hand, a roof of heavy tiles is first laid out, and in the deep, spacious shadows created
         by the eaves the rest of the structure is built. Nor is this true only of temples;in the places
          of the nobility and the houses of the common people, what first strikes the eye is the massive
          roof of tile or thatch and the heavy darkness that hangs beneath the eaves. Even at midday cavernous
         darkness spreads over all beneath the roof's edge, making entryway,doors, walls, and pillars all
          but invisible. The grand temples of Kyoto-Chion'in, Honganji-and the farmhouses of the remote
          countryside are alike in this respect: like most buildings of the past their roofs give the impression
          of possessing far greater weight, height, and surface than all that stands beneath the eaves

        <center>In making for ourselves a place to live, we first spread a parasol to throw a shadow on the earth, and
          in the pale light of the shadow we put together a house. There are of course roofs on Western houses
           too, but they are less to keep off the sun than to keep off the wind and the dew; even from without
           it is apparent that they are built to create as few shadows as possible and to expose the interior 
           to as much light as possible. If the roof of a Japanese house is a parasol, the roof of a Western
           house is no more than a cap, with as small a visor as possible so as to allow the sunlight to
           penetrate directly beneath the eaves. There are no doubt all sorts of reasons-climate, building materials-
           for the deep Japanese eaves. The fact that we did not use glass, concrete, and bricks, for instance,
           made a low roof necessary to keep off the driving wind and rain. A light room would no doubt have been
           more convenient for us, too, than a dark room. The quality that we call beauty, however, must always
           grow from the realities of life, and our ancestors, forced to live in dark rooms, presently came to
           discover beauty in shadows, ultimately to guide shadows towards beauty's ends.</center>

      <h2>
        <center>And so it has come to be that the beauty of a Japanese room depends on a variation of shadows, heavy
          shadows against light shadows-it has nothing else. Westerners are amazed at the simplicity of Japanese
          rooms, perceiving in them no more than ashen walls bereft of ornament. Their reaction
          is understandable, but it betrays a failure to comprehend the mystery of shadows. Out beyond the
          sitting room, which the rays of the sun can at best but barely reach, we extend the eaves or build
          on a veranda, putting the sunlight at still greater a remove. The light from the garden steals in but
          dimly through paper-paneled doors, and it is precisely this indirect light that makes for us the charm
          of a room. We do our walls in neutral colors so that the sad, fragile, dying rays can sink into absolute
          repose. The storehouse, kitchen, hallways, and such may have a glossy finish, but the walls of the
          sitting room will almost always be of day textured with fine sand. A luster here would destroy the soft
          fragile beauty of the feeble light. We delight in the mere sight of the delicate glow of fading rays
          clinging to the surface of a dusky wall, there to live out what little life remains to them. We never
          tire of the sight, for to us this pale glow and these dim shadows far surpass any ornament.</center>
