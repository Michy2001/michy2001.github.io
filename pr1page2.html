            <h2>
                <center>And so it has come to be that the beauty of a Japanese room depends on a variation of shadows, heavy</center>
                <center>shadows against light shadows-it has nothing else. Westerners are amazed at the simplicity of Japanese</center>
                <center>rooms, perceiving in them no more than ashen walls bereft of ornament. Their reaction</center>
                <center>is understandable, but it betrays a failure to comprehend the mystery of shadows. Out beyond the</center>
                <center>sitting room, which the rays of the sun can at best but barely reach, we extend the eaves or build</center>
                <center>on a veranda, putting the sunlight at still greater a remove. The light from the garden steals in but</center>
                <center>dimly through paper-paneled doors, and it is precisely this indirect light that makes for us the charm</center>
                <center>of a room. We do our walls in neutral colors so that the sad, fragile, dying rays can sink into absolute</center>
                <center>repose. The storehouse, kitchen, hallways, and such may have a glossy finish, but the walls of the</center>
                <center>sitting room will almost always be of day textured with fine sand. A luster here would destroy the soft</center>
                <center>fragile beauty of the feeble light. We delight in the mere sight of the delicate glow of fading rays</center>
                <center>clinging to the surface of a dusky wall, there to live out what little life remains to them. We never</center>
                <center>tire of the sight, for to us this pale glow and these dim shadows far surpass any ornament. And so, as</center>
                <center>we must if we are not to disturb the glow, we finish the walls with sand in a single neutral color. The</center>
                <center>hue may differ from room to room, but the degree of difference will be ever so slight; not so much</center>
                <center>a difference in color as in shade, a difference that will seem to exist only in the mood of the viewer.</center>
                <center>And from these delicate differences in the hue of the walls, the shadows in each room take on a tinge</center>
                <center>peculiarly their own.</center>

                <center>Of course the Japanese room does have its picture alcove, and in it a hanging scroll and a flower arrangement.</center>
                <center> But the scroll and the flowers serve not as ornament but rather to give depth to the shadows. We value a</center>
                <center>scroll above all for the way it blends with the walls of the alcove, and thus we consider the mounting quite</center>
                <center>as important as the calligraphy or painting. Even the greatest masterpiece will lose its worth as a scroll</center>
                <center>if it fails to blend with the alcove, while a work of no particular distinction may blend beautifully with</center>
                <center>the room and set off to unexpected advantage both itself and its surroundings. Wherein lies the power of</center>
                <center>an otherwise ordinary work to produce such an effect? Most often the paper, the ink, the fabric of the</center>
                <center>mounting will possess a certain look of antiquity, and this look of antiquity will strike just the right</center>
                <center>balance with the darkness of the alcove and room. We have all had the experience, on a visit to one of</center>
                <center>Kyoto or Nara, of being shown a scroll, one of the temple's treasures, hanging in a large, deeply recessed</center>
                <center>alcove. So dark are these alcoves, even in bright daylight, that we can hardly discern the outlines of</center>
                <center>the work; all we can do is listen to the explanation of the guide, follow as best we can the all-but </center>
                <center>invisible brush strokes, and tell ourselves how magnificent a painting it must be. Yet the combination of </center>
                <center>that blurred old painting and the dark alcove is one of absolute harmony. The lack of clarity, far from</center>
                <center> disturbing us, seems rather to suit the painting perfectly.</center>
