                <center>And so, as we must if we are not to disturb the glow, we finish the walls with sand in a single neutral color.</center>
                <center>The hue may differ from room to room, but the degree of difference will be ever so slight; not so much</center>
                <center>a difference in color as in shade, a difference that will seem to exist only in the mood of the viewer.</center>
                <center>And from these delicate differences in the hue of the walls, the shadows in each room take on a tinge</center>
                <center>peculiarly their own. Of course the Japanese room does have its picture alcove, and in it a hanging scroll and</center>
                <center>a flower arrangement. But the scroll and the flowers serve not as ornament but rather to give depth to the </center>
                <center>shadows. We value a croll above all for the way it blends with the walls of the alcove, and thus we consider</center>
                <center>the mounting quite as important as the calligraphy or painting. Even the greatest masterpiece will lose its</center>
                <center>worth as a scroll if it fails to blend with the alcove, while a work of no particular distinction may</center>
                <center>blend beautifully with the room and set off to unexpected advantage both itself and its surroundings.</center>

                <center>Wherein lies the power of an otherwise ordinary work to produce such an effect? Most often the paper, the ink,</center>
                <center>the fabric of the mounting will possess a certain look of antiquity, and this look of antiquity will strike</center>
                <center>just the right balance with the darkness of the alcove and room. We have all had the experience, on a </center>
                <center>visit to one of Kyoto or Nara, of being shown a scroll, one of the temple's treasures, hanging in a large,</center>
                <center>deeply recessed alcove. So dark are these alcoves, even in bright daylight, that we can hardly discern the</center>
                <center>outlines of the work; all we can do is listen to the explanation of the guide, follow as best we can the</center>
                <center>all-but invisible brush strokes, and tell ourselves how magnificent a painting it must be. Yet the combination</center>
                <center>of that blurred old painting and the dark alcove is one of absolute harmony. The lack of clarity, far</center>
                <center>from disturbing us, seems rather to suit the painting perfectly.</center>
